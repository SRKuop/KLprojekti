Hello
This is just a calorie counter Im working on. At the moment of writing this, it is still very much not finished product, but itll get there. Currently it just adds profiles, counts how much calories user needs to have daily, and based on the given info, it will count how much the weight of the user changes. I have some other features on the planning table at the moment also but mostly this is a bit of a passion project in which I can combine my passion for sports and training to new interest in coding and programming.

Also all the prints are currently in finnish. I might do a translated version when Im done with the whole thing but it will take time. One of the features Im working on will take some time so Im not setting any deadlines at this point of time.

If you see some bit of a code you want to use feel free to ctrl+c and ctrl+v.
